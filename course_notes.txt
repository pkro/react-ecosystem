Main reason for using the react ecosystem: separation of concerns

redux: concern: state of the app
react-thunk: side effect management (network requestts etc)
reselect: abstract away the state's structure
styled components: component styling, esp. when appearance depends on state

npx runs executables installed by npm
"npm run" runs scripts defined in package.json / "scripts"
